## Last Week's Accomplishments

> So far I have been working on finding a cheaper microcontroller. We were origionally using a
> Raspberry Pi 3 which costs over $40. Through my reasearch I disovered the Node MCU Lua ESP8266
> boards which sell for $6 on Amazon and have Arduino + WiFi. If we need bluetooth, might go with
> the Raspberry Pi 0.

## This Week's Plan

> Plan to get some Node MCU boards and try to figure out how to control them over Wifi.

## Anything Blocking?

> Not sure of the requirements. Need blutooth? Long range NFC? What do out useres want?

## Notes

> Look into means of controlling Node MCU: Adafruit IO (MQTT), Google Firebase,
> AWS IoT (Amazon MQTT).
