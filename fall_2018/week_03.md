## Last Week's Accomplishments

>Looked into connecting to school WiFi. Arduino does not seem to have
>support for WPA2_Enterprise. Looked into connecting via acesspoint/
>bluetooth. Also looking into creating an Android Firebase App to 
>control the board.

## This Week's Plan

> Work on android app and getting a functional demo. 

> Try to get an estimate size for the enclosure

> Jing-Wei got the app working with the old API on Git. Perhaps try to
> use that and get it running in a server?

## Anything Blocking?

> Arduino library does not appear to have support for WPA2 Enterprise
> PEAP network.
> Probably can get a personal network if the demo is sucessful?

## Notes
