## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Since having difficuties connecting to RPI WPA Enterprise WiFi,
> started to shift board design to BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)

> Jing-Wei got his app to connect and control an Arduino UNO
> and light up an LED!! :-)


## This Week's Plan

> Plot out new BLE Circuit design (Arduino Nano & SH-HC-08 BLE Module)

> Try to get this wired up to a relay so we can get a functional demo

> Order parts and assemble a sample board

> Improve security and implement feedback over BLE

> Test it on a actual door?

> Work on Android App?

## Anything Blocking?

> Need to get parts and get acess to door

## Notes

> BLE currently just sends 'a' to toggle switch state
> no encoding, no feedback
