## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Finished shrinking PCB designs and changing up a few of the parts. They are
> now 4in x 1in

> Found the old cheap fabrication company I used previously called BasicPCB.
> Got a quote for 3 boards: $30.75


## This Week's Plan

> Find and order parts for constructing a PCB

> Verify PCB design with a professor? (in case we go with a cheap 
> fabrication which does not provide design checking)

> Give dimensions to Anton so he can finish the enclosure design

> Start thinking about other improvements?

## Anything Blocking?

> Just need to find time to get the board design approved by a professor.

## Notes

> Need to get this out there. Get funding? Close source parts of the project?
