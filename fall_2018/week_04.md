## Last Week's Accomplishments

>Got some relays for the opening device. Small enough to mount back to
>back with the Node MCU Boards

>Talked to father about developing an Android version of the app, developed
>a basic app able to display a map, now working on door markers

## This Week's Plan

> Improve the Android app structure and functionality

> Imporve Firebase structure to work better with the app (include board 
> ids and GPS coordinates)

> Try to get an estimate size for the enclosure by combining relays with
> the Node MCU boards

> Jing-Wei got the app working with the old API on Git. Perhaps try to
> use that and get it running in a server?

> Someone needs to implement Firebase or some other connection to boards
> in an app to get a functional prototype.

## Anything Blocking?

> Hoping to have John work on app.
> Need to decide what protocol to connect with board (Firebase, AWS IOT, MQTT, etc.)
> Implement connection to get functional prototype.
> Arduino library does not appear to have support for WPA2 Enterprise
> PEAP network.
> Probably can get a personal network if the demo is sucessful?

## Notes

> React Native so as to run all all mobile devices?

> If WiFi does not work try BLE (Bluetooth)
