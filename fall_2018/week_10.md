## Semester Project Summary

> This semester we improved the design and price point of the 
> project, moving from a Raspberry Pi 3 based design to an 
> Arduino Nano based design, reducing our price point from $35 
> to $4 - $5 for per microcontroller.

> We moved from a WiFi controlled design to a BLE (Bluetooth) 
> based design in order to avoid conflict with the school's 
> WPA2 Enterprise network license which microcontrollers have 
> difficulty connecting to.

> We tested our new board with the latest build of the iOS app
> on an actual door in Amos Eaton and it functioned perfectly. 
> We also have performed some range testing and demonstrated
> that the board has more than a 100ft range (provided there 
> are no obstructions)

> We sketched up a PCB for the project and consolidated the 
> design to fit on a 4in x 1in PCB.

> Next we plan on attempting to expand funding and support for 
> our project once we finalize the final PCB design and 
> fabricate the first couple boards. In order to do this we 
> must first obtain information regarding the power source 
> available to us inside the door box. Then we can finalize 
> the design, have it checked, and get it cheaply fabricated
> (maybe by Basic PCB? Cheapest fabrication in the US, about 
> $35 for 3 but no error checking)
