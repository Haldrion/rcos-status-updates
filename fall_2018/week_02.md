## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Got 2 Node MCU boards w/ power supplies on Monday. Managed to connect them to Wifi
> and contol an led light over Google Firebase. Coded a basic HTML UI. Also managed
> to use Adafruit IO to connect but Adafruit charges $100 per year after 5 boards.

## This Week's Plan

> Currently have to connect thru computer (Mobile Hotspot). Need to try and figure out
> how to connect to RPI's wpa2 enterprise network. Also try to get John or Jing Wei to 
> code a iOS app which works with Firebase.

## Anything Blocking?

> Default Adruino library connects to basic WPA2 with only ssid and password
> Need to try and figure out how to connect to RPI's WPA2 enterprise network
> which has ssid, username, and password.

## Notes

> Look into means of connecting to wpa2 enterprise.
