## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Went to Amos Eaton for testing Nov 27 and set up the full circuit with the
> relay and wired it to the door

> We tested it with the app and IT WORKS!!

> We modified the code on the Arduino so that the relay is only turned on for
> a short time, allowing the door to close automatically and updating the door
> status accurately.


## This Week's Plan

> Find and order parts for constructing a PCB

> Shrink PCB design to reduce cost

> Verify PCB design with a professor? (in case we go with a cheap 
> fabriction which does not provide design checking)

> Find a low-cost PCB fabriction service and get some PCBs fabricated (Basic PCB?)

> Give dimensions to Anton so he can finish the enclosure design

> Start thinking about other improvements?

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing!!

## Notes

> Sucessful testing! Yay! :-)
