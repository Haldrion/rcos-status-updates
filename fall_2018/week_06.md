## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Started sketching up the circuit in Fritzing. Pretty much done with
> breadboard diagram, just want to check wiring with Jing-Wei and John.

> Tested out the range of the device, could go down entire hallway on
> 2nd Floor DCC without losing connection. However, walls reduce the
> range significantly (about half the range without obstruction)


## This Week's Plan

> Finish Fritzing sketch of new BLE Circuit design
> (Arduino Nano & SH-HC-08 BLE Module) with a full schematic and PCB
> design (in case we decide to properly fabricate the boards)

> Try to get this wired up to a relay so we can get a functional demo

> Order parts and assemble a sample board

> Improve security and implement feedback over BLE

> Test it on an actual door?

> Work on Android App?

## Anything Blocking?

> Just waiting for FIXX permission to test board on a door

## Notes

> Upcoming presentation to rest of RCOS next week.
